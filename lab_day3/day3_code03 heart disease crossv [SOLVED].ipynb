We used the same object in the lesson, so feel free to refer to that code for reference. As a reminder, to use it porperly you'll need to:\n","\n","* import the class\n","* declare a StratifiedKFold object telling the constructor how many folds (`n_splits`) you want\n","* loop over folds via the `.split()` method, which requires the data (features and target) as input and returns the indices of the current split\n","\n","**ASSIGNMENT** modify the loop you wrote in the previous exercise so that the model is trained 5 times on different splits of (`features_train`, `target_train`). Print the loss and val_loss averaged over the folds.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KPD0WjsjuzMC","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1631604590294,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":34005,"user":{"displayName":"Nelson Nazzicari","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgArOt61KuUpm4iKPq7j-oDcGINWQeMziaxc5Fy3Q=s64","userId":"06091096357258353861"}},"outputId":"fd6a62c0-e9b5-4543-dc23-652ee25b2667"},"source":["######## YOUR CODE HERE ########\n","from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\n","\n","#same code as exercise 3, up to a point.\n","\n","#a double loop to explore the parameters\n","for layers in layers_list:\n","  for units in units_list:\n","    #a little user interface\n","    print('Layers:' + str(layers) + ' units:', str(units))\n","\n","    #getting the model\n","    m = build_model(layers, units, features_train.shape[1])\n","\n","    #compiling\n","    m.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='binary_crossentropy')\n","    \n","    #we'll put the losses for the five folds in these two container\n","    folds_loss = []\n","    folds_val_loss = []\n","\n","    #a counter for the folds, useful for keeping track of what's going on\n","    f = 0\n","\n","    #declaring the splitter\n","    skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits = 5)\n","\n","    #loop over folds\n","    for train_index_cv, val_index_cv in skf.split(features_train, target_train):\n","      #informing the user\n","      f += 1\n","      print('- fold: ' + str(f))\n","\n","      #extracting the data for this fold\n","      features_train_cv = features_train.iloc[train_index_cv, :]\n","      features_val_cv   = features_train.iloc[val_index_cv, :]\n","      target_train_cv   = target_train.iloc[train_index_cv]\n","      target_val_cv     = target_train.iloc[val_index_cv]\n","\n","      #fitting\n","      history = m.fit(\n","          features_train_cv, target_train_cv, \n","          epochs=20, \n","          validation_data=(features_val_cv, target_val_cv), verbose=0)\n","    \n","      #we just store the losses at the last epoch\n","      folds_loss.append(history.history['loss'][-1])\n","      folds_val_loss.append(history.history['val_loss'][-1])\n","    \n","    #we have finished the folds, it's time to print the averaged results\n","    print(' - train loss     : ' + str(sum(folds_loss) / len(folds_loss)))\n","    print(' - validation loss: ' + str(sum(folds_val_loss) / len(folds_val_loss)))\n","################################\n"],"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Layers:1 units: 2\n","- fold: 1\n","- fold: 2\n","- fold: 3\n","- fold: 4\n","- fold: 5\n"," - train loss     : 0.9027903795242309\n"," - validation loss: 0.8901168584823609\n","Layers:1 units: 4\n","- fold: 1\n","- fold: 2\n","- fold: 3\n","- fold: 4\n","- fold: 5\n"," - train loss     : 2.792648434638977\n"," - validation loss: 2.6330357074737547\n","Layers:2 units: 2\n","- fold: 1\n","- fold: 2\n","- fold: 3\n","- fold: 4\n","- fold: 5\n"," - train loss     : 0.6722147583961486\n"," - validation loss: 0.7053159594535827\n","Layers:2 units: 4\n","- fold: 1\n","- fold: 2\n","- fold: 3\n","- fold: 4\n","- fold: 5\n"," - train loss     : 3.1549142718315126\n"," - validation loss: 2.6342898488044737\n","Layers:3 units: 2\n","- fold: 1\n","- fold: 2\n","- fold: 3\n","- fold: 4\n","- fold: 5\n"," - train loss     : 0.6906232118606568\n"," - validation loss: 0.6907481551170349\n","Layers:3 units: 4\n","- fold: 1\n","- fold: 2\n","- fold: 3\n","- fold: 4\n","- fold: 5\n"," - train loss     : 0.6938130378723144\n"," - validation loss: 0.7850853323936462\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hdVvXGm5ze0a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1631604590299,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":41,"user":{"displayName":"Nelson Nazzicari","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgArOt61KuUpm4iKPq7j-oDcGINWQeMziaxc5Fy3Q=s64","userId":"06091096357258353861"}}},"source":[""],"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]}]}
