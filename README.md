# Coding excercises
Coding exercises, slides and datasets used in the 2020 course [Introduction to deep learning for biologists](https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course67/).

Exercises are in the form of [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and can be either downloaded and run locally or explored online via platforms such as [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (a free Google account is required) or [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks) (a free Kaggle account plus phone verification is required).

## Python - basic skills

These exercises showcase some basic Python concepts, plus the use of most common modules. 

Launch everything on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ne1s0n/coding_excercises/HEAD)(it may take a few minutes to load)
