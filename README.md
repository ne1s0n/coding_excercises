# What is this?
This repo contains slides and datasets used in the 2022 course [Introduction to deep learning for biologists](https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course67/). Material is released during the course week and will stay online a few months after the course.

Exercises are in the form of [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and can be either downloaded and run locally or explored online via platforms such as [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (a free Google account is required) or [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks) (a free Kaggle account plus phone verification is required).

## Python - basic skills

This section moved to the code-only repo [bioinformateachers](https://github.com/ne1s0n/bioinformateachers), which supports the bioinformatics-oriented educational website [The Bioinformateachers](https://bioinformateachers.wordpress.com/).

## Slides

[Here you find](slides) all the slides used in the course (we upload them at the end of each day).

## Codes

All codes used during the lessons plus some extra exercises and solutions are found in the
various lab folders (e.g. [lab_day1](lab_day1/)).
