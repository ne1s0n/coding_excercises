These are only five species of the 33 available.

Original images were .tif, I changed format to .png using imagemagick
and resized all image widths to 800 pixels. 
Also, I standardized file structure to the following:

- train/<one subfolder per species>
- test/<one subfolder per species>

Given that each species originally had ~20 samples, I put four images in
each test subfolder.
